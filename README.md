# Billing_System_Using_Tkinter
It is an inclusion of an online shopping billing system that helps you to login, create an account for the shop, choose items as necessity demands, check your cart which is updated each time you visit it, and finally, log out of your account in the front-end. In the back-end, you (the shop owner) get to add a product for sale, remove a product from sale, display order details and also display user details. This project is done using Python Tkinter module for an internship opportunity I got in my third semester doing my BTech degree (2018 - 2022 batch).

This particular project is an integration of Linux Shell Scripting and Python programming. So, while executing, download all the files and run the shell program with the extension .sh (billing.sh) using the command ./billing.sh after you go into the directory where you saved the files. This executes the entire program in the necessary sequence. It merges both front-end and back-end seamlessly.

NOTE : KEEP ALL THE DOWNLOADED FILES IN THE SAME DIRECTORY.
