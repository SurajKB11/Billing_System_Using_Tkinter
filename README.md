# Billing_System_Using_Tkinter
It is an inclusion of front-end and back-end applications of an online shopping billing system that helps you to login, create an account for the shop, choose items as necessity demands, check your cart which is updated each time you visit it, and finally, log out of your account in the front-end. In the back-end, you (the shop owner) get to add a product for sale, remove a product from sale, display order details and also display user details. This project is done using Python Tkinter module for an internship opportunity I got in my third semester doing my BTech degree (2018 - 2022 batch).
